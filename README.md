## About Me
My name is Khin Chan Thar, and I am currently studying Bachelor of Science(Data Science). Through this course, I aim to improve my ability to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- **Consistency is Key**: Following consistent naming conventions and formatting improves readability and maintainability.
- **Keep It Simple**: Avoid unnecessary complexity; simpler solutions are often better.
- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to make the code self-explanatory.
