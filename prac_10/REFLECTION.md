# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate were fairly accurate, but some of the time I underestimated how difficult the task could be, especially when it comes to debugging or dealing with edge cases. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As it progressed, I became more realistic when it came to my estimates. I learned how to break the task into smaller manageable pieces as well as factor in additional time than I expected because there are unexpected challenges which helped me with my overall estimate accuracy.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that I should add extra time around 30 mins to an hour based on how complex the debugging is going to be. Being too optimistic often lead to time pressure which could be reduced with better planning. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned that code review helps me with the valuable feedback on areas that I might have overlooked like code readability, refactoring for efficiency and for best practices without cutting corners. I think that constructive feedback helps me improve my skills and avoid making the same mistakes in future works.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned that by reviewing other's code, it requires me to strengthen my skills like attention to detail and empathy. It's important on my side to give a clear and constructive suggestions wile recognizing and praising the strength of the code. I also learned new ways and approaches by looking at how others solve the same problems.  

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac06-Code Review](https://github.com/NaingPhonePyae/cp1404practicals/pull/2)
Consider adding error handling for potential ValueError exceptions when convertign input to int
### Explanation

This review is good because it identifies a potential error that could crash the program if it's not handled properly. By suggesting error handling, it helps improve the user experience. The feedback is constructive and directly improves the quality of the code without being very critical. 

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 9](https://github.com/mariiakostina/cp1404practicals/pull/5/files)
Add constants for easier tweaking for your code



### Explanation

This review is good because it identifies a potential runtime error that could crash the program if not handled properly. By suggesting the addition of error handling, it helps improve the program's robustness and user experience. The feedback is constructive and directly improves the quality of the code without being overly critical.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think I'd introduce group works and presentation to provide a place to learn new skills from each other as well as diversify the projects to showcase new Python projects. I think exploring Kivy more would enhance our understanding of the app and it's capabilities so that we could refine our work based on the feedback from the weekly reviews. I think it would also help if the suggest outputs are given to clarify topics and understand what is expected which would help us understand and troubleshoot the problem faster. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was able to effectively manage time and break down complex tasks into manageable steps really well. I also look out for resources when needed so that it would help me when I encounter challenging tasks so that I stay on track throughout the course.
